Specifically, we propose to describe junctions, line segments and relationships between them with a simple graph, which is more structured and informative than end-point representation used in existing line segment detection methods.

Specifically, we first introduce a new representation, namely a semantics-aware distance map (sem-dist map), to serve as our target for amodal segmentation instead of the commonly used masks and heatmaps. The sem-dist map is a kind of level-set representation, of which the different regions of an object are placed into different levels on the map according to their visibility. It is a natural extension of masks and heatmaps, where modal, amodal segmentation, as well as depth order information, are all well-described. Then we also introduce a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which we refer to as semantic layering network, to estimate sem-dist maps layer by layer, from the global-level to the instance-level, for all objects in an image. Extensive experiments on the COCOA and D2SA datasets have demonstrated that our framework can predict amodal segmentation, occlusion and depth order with state-of-the-art performance.","tags":["Amodal Segmentation","CNN"],"title":"Learning Semantics-aware Distance Map with Semantics Layering Network for Amodal Instance Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yanyu Xu","Zhixin Piao","Wen Liu","Ziheng Zhang","Jingyi Yu","Shenghua Gao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.

By combining the task-specific features with common features with a feature consolidation module in a coarse-to-fine manner, we can get the initial prediction for parsing and 2D pose estimation; In feature union stage, we refine the initial prediction by explicitly leveraging the features from parallel task to predict the kernels' receptive fields in a convolutional neural network.

On detail synthesis, we present a Deep Facial Detail Net (DFDN) based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Net (CGAN) that employs both geometry and appearance loss functions. For geometry, we capture 366 high-quality 3D scans from 122 different subjects under 3 facial expressions. For appearance, we use additional 20K in-the-wild face images and apply image-based rendering to accommodate lighting variations.

Specifically, we propose to decompose gaze point estimation into eyeball pose, head pose, and 3D eye position estimation. Compared with RGB image-based gaze tracking, having depth modality helps to facilitate head pose estimation and 3D eye position estimation. The captured depth image, however, usually contains noise and black holes which noticeably hamper gaze tracking. Thus we propose a CNN-based multi-task learning framework to simultaneously refine depth images and predict gaze points. We utilize a generator network for depth image generation with a Generative Neural Network (GAN), where the generator network is partially shared by both the gaze tracking network and GAN-based depth synthesizing. By optimizing the whole network simultaneously, depth image synthesis improves gaze point estimation and vice versa. Since the only existing RGBD dataset (EYEDIAP) is too small, we build a large-scale RGBD gaze tracking dataset for performance evaluation. As far as we know, it is the largest RGBD gaze dataset in terms of the number of participants. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods by a large margin on both our dataset and the EYEDIAP dataset.","tags":["Gaze Estimation","CNN"],"title":"RGBD Based Gaze Estimation via Multi-task CNN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziheng Zhang*","Yanyu Xu*","Jingyi Yu","Shenghua Gao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Specifically, in our spherical convolution neural network definition, kernel is defined on a spherical crown, and the convolution involves the rotation of the kernel along the sphere. Considering that the 360 videos are usually stored with equirectangular panorama, we propose to implement the spherical convolution on panorama by stretching and rotating the kernel based on the location of patch to be convolved. Compared with existing spherical convolution, our definition has the parameter sharing property, which would greatly reduce the parameters to be learned. We further take the temporal coherence of the viewing process into consideration, and propose a sequential saliency detection by leveraging a spherical U-Net. To validate our approach, we construct a large-scale 360 videos saliency detection benchmark that consists of 104 360 videos viewed by 20+ human subjects. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our spherical U-net for 360 video saliency detection.","tags":["Saliency Detection","Spherical Convolution","CNN"],"title":"Saliency Detection in 360° Videos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziheng Zhang","Jia Zheng","Shenghua Gao","Yi Ma"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.
